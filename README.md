# Open-Object-System

A multi-purpose object system. The software will be usage agnostic and platform agnostic. It will be built on technologies that are widely useable on a number of platforms, such as C++, OpenGL, TCP/IP, and MIDI.  

The system will have objects that do the following: -

1. Display 3D models.
2. Act as neurons.
3. Generate sounds.
4. Output MIDI data.
5. Display bitmaps.
6. Accept incoming MIDI data.
7. Output audio data.
8. Accept incoming audio data.
9. Act as switches.
10. Generate bitmaps.
11. Generate 3D models.
12. Act as cameras.
13. Spawn other objects.
14. Remove other objects.
15. Effect other objects via gravity.
16. Emit light.
17. Emit sound.
18. Disable other objects.
19. Accept incoming video data.
20. Output video data.
21. Display videos.
22. Display text.
23. Act as a container for scripts.
24. Play sounds files.
25. Enable other objects.
26. Accept incoming data from pointing devices.
27. Accept incoming data from keyboards.
28. Accept incoming data from networks.
29. Send data over networks.
30. Interact with databases.
31. Read text files.
32. Write text files.
33. Generate numbers.
34. Act as universe portals.
35. Act as microphones.

The system will also have other objects with other functions.

The objects will exist inside a virtual three dimensional space. A two dimensional display will be possible by setting up a camera suitably and snapping all objects to zero on the Z axis. 

Users will be able to connect objects together using virtual patch leads. Some objects will be able to autonomously connect to and disconnect from other objects. Connections between objects will use inputs and outputs. Each object will be able to have a large number of inputs and outputs. Inputs and outputs will have data transfer types, such as numbers, text, audio, video, script, and MIDI.

It will be possible to group objects together using various methods such as the following: -

1. Grouping - Objects retain their previous spacial relationships.
2. Clustering - Objects are stuck together in a cluster with close to zero distance between them.
3. Universing - A sub universe is created and the selected objects moved to the new universe.

Objects will have parameters that are addressable by a scripting language.
